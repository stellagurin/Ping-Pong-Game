# Ping Pong Game

This application uses a mix of Java and Java FX 8 to display a ping pong game. To start the game, the user should press 'P' to play. 
Once the game starts, the user has to control how fast the paddles can move up and down the screen from each side to hit the ball. If one side 
misses, one of the players get a point. You need 3 points to win.
